1. What does our program do
	
	Given a point set in R^2 our program would compute simplicial depth of each point and perform a lifting into R^3 in which the depth is visualized as the 3rd spatial coordinate

2. How do i get it run
	The program would be deployed as a java applet. It would be written in Processing.

3. What is the input
	The input can be done manually by clicking on the plane. Also we can randomly generate a point set given a integer.

4. How does the basic algorithm work?
